# üöÄ Chapter 2: Search Algorithms 

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to Search Problems
- **Search algorithms** ‚Üí  Used when an agent needs to find a sequence of actions that **leads to a goal**
  - These algorithms help **navigate problem spaces** efficiently
- **Complete Search Algorithm** ‚Üí An algorithm that finds the destination if it exists and notifies the caller if the destination doesn't exist

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Components of a Search Problem
1. **Initial State** ‚Üí The starting point of the agent.
2. **Actions** ‚Üí All possible actions the agent can take.
3. **Transition Model** ‚Üí A description of how each action changes the state.
4. **Goal Test** ‚Üí Determines if the current state is the goal.
5. **Path Cost** ‚Üí The numerical cost of a path from the start to a goal.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Time & Space Complexity ‚è≥üíæ
### **Time Complexity**
- Measures how the **running time of an algorithm** increases as the input size grows
- A loop running through **n** elements has **O(n) time complexity**

### **Space Complexity**
- Measures the **amount of memory** an algorithm uses in relation to input size
- A recursive function storing **n** recursive calls has **O(n) space complexity**

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Search Algorithms
Search algorithms are categorized into two types:

### **Uninformed Search (Blind Search)**
- No additional information about the goal except how to determine if a state is a goal
  
  üìå Example algorithms:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - **Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)**

### **Informed Search (Heuristic Search)**
- Uses heuristics to estimate the cost to the goal, making search more efficient
  
  üìå Example algorithms:
  - **Greedy Best-First Search**
  - A* **Search**
  - **Hill Climbing**

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Breadth-First Search (BFS) üîç
### **Overview**
- **BFS explores all nodes at the present row/depth level before moving on to nodes at the next row**
- It guarantees the **shortest path** in an **unweighted** graph
- Uses a **FIFO (First In, First Out) queue**

### **Algorithm (Pseudocode)**
```python
BFS(graph, start_node, end_node):
    frontier = new Queue()
    frontier.enqueue(start_node)
    explored = new Set()

    while frontier is not empty:
        current_node = frontier.dequeue()
        if current_node in explored:
            continue
        if current_node == end_node:
            return success

        for neighbor in graph.get_neighbors(current_node):
            frontier.enqueue(neighbor)

        explored.add(current_node)
```

#### **Time & Space Complexity**
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(V + E)\) (where \(V\) is vertices, \(E\) is edges)
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(V)\) due to the queue and visited set



#### **Why is BFS an optimal algorithm?**
It visits all possible nodes that are one hop from the source, then checks all that are 2 hop, etc. until it reaches the destination

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Depth-First Search (DFS) üîç
### **Overview**
- **DFS explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking**
- Uses a **LIFO (Last In, First Out) stack**

### **Algorithm (Iterative Version)**
```python
def dfs_iterative(graph, start):
    stack = [start]
    visited = set()
    while stack:
        v = stack.pop()
        if v not in visited:
            print(v, end=' ')
            visited.add(v)
            for neighbor in graph[v]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    stack.append(neighbor)
```

### **Algorithm (Recursive Version)**
```python
def dfs_recursive(graph, s, visited=set()):
    print(s, end=' ')
    visited.add(s)
    for neighbor in graph[s]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs_recursive(graph, neighbor, visited)
```

#### **Time & Space Complexity**
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(V + E)\)  
- **Space Complexity:**
  - **Recursive:** \(O(V)\) (due to recursion stack)
  - **Iterative:** \(O(V)\) (due to explicit stack)

| **Completeness** | ‚úÖ Yes (always finds solution if one exists) | ‚ùå No (may get stuck in infinite loops if cycles exist without detection) |
| **Optimality** | ‚úÖ Yes (if costs are uniform) | ‚ùå No |
